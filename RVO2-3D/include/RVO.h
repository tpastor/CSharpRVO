<b>RVO2-3D Library</b> is an easy-to-use C++ implementation of the
<a href="http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/CA/">Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance</a>

automatically uses parallelism for computing the motion of the agents if your machine
has multiple processors and your compiler supports <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">
OpenMP</a>.

@section    localca     Three Dimensions

In contrast to RVO2 Library, <b>RVO2-3D Library</b> operates in 3D workspaces. It uses
a three dimensional implementation of <a href="http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/CA/">Optimal

be used.

@page       using       Using RVO2-3D Library

@section    structure   Structure

A program performing an <b>RVO2-3D Library</b> simulation has the following global
structure.

@code
#include <RVO.h>

std::vector<RVO::Vector3> goals;

int main()
{
  // Create a new simulator instance.
  RVO::RVOSimulator* sim = new RVO::RVOSimulator();

  // Set up the scenario.
  setupScenario(sim);

  // Perform (and manipulate) the simulation.
  do {
    updateVisualization(sim);
    setPreferredVelocities(sim);
    sim->doStep();
  } while (!reachedGoal(sim));

  delete sim;
}
@endcode

In order to use <b>RVO2-3D Library</b>, the user needs to include RVO.h. The first
step is then to create an instance of RVO::RVOSimulator. Then, the process
consists of two stages. The first stage is specifying the simulation scenario
and its parameters. In the above example program, this is done in the method
setupScenario(...), which we will discuss below. The second stage is the actual
performing of the simulation.

In the above example program, simulation steps are taken until all
the agents have reached some predefined goals. Prior to each simulation step,
we set the preferred velocity for each agent, i.e. the
velocity the agent would have taken if there were no other agents around, in the
method setPreferredVelocities(...). The simulator computes the actual velocities
of the agents and attempts to follow the preferred velocities as closely as
possible while guaranteeing collision avoidance at the same time. During the
simulation, the user may want to retrieve information from the simulation for
instance to visualize the simulation. In the above example program, this is done
in the method updateVisualization(...), which we will discuss below. It is also
possible to manipulate the simulation during the simulation, for instance by
changing positions, radii, velocities, etc. of the agents.

@section    spec        Setting up the Simulation Scenario

A scenario that is to be simulated can be set up as follows. A scenario consists
of a set of agents that can be manually specified. Agents may be added anytime
before or during the simulation. The user may also want to define goal positions
of the agents, or a roadmap to guide the agents around obstacles. This is not done
in <b>RVO2-3D Library</b>, but needs to be taken care of in the user's external
application.

The following example creates a scenario with eight agents exchanging positions.

@code
void setupScenario(RVO::RVOSimulator* sim) {
  // Specify global time step of the simulation.
  sim->setTimeStep(0.25f);

  // Specify default parameters for agents that are subsequently added.
  sim->setAgentDefaults(15.0f, 10, 10.0f, 2.0f, 2.0f);

  // Add agents, specifying their start position.
  sim->addAgent(RVO::Vector3(-50.0f, -50.0f, -50.0f));
  sim->addAgent(RVO::Vector3(50.0f, -50.0f, -50.0f));
  sim->addAgent(RVO::Vector3(50.0f, 50.0f, -50.0f));
  sim->addAgent(RVO::Vector3(-50.0f, 50.0f, -50.0f));
  sim->addAgent(RVO::Vector3(-50.0f, -50.0f, 50.0f));
  sim->addAgent(RVO::Vector3(50.0f, -50.0f, 50.0f));
  sim->addAgent(RVO::Vector3(50.0f, 50.0f, 50.0f));
  sim->addAgent(RVO::Vector3(-50.0f, 50.0f, 50.0f));

  // Create goals (simulator is unaware of these).
  for (size_t i = 0; i < sim->getNumAgents(); ++i) {
    goals.push_back(-sim->getAgentPosition(i));
  }
}
@endcode

See the documentation on RVO::RVOSimulator for a full overview of the
functionality to specify scenarios.

@section    ret         Retrieving Information from the Simulation

During the simulation, the user can extract information from the simulation for
instance for visualization purposes, or to determine termination conditions of
the simulation. In the example program above, visualization is done in the
updateVisualization(...) method. Below we give an example that simply writes
the positions of each agent in each time step to the standard output. The
termination condition is checked in the reachedGoal(...) method. Here we give an
example that returns true if all agents are within one radius of their goals.

@code
void updateVisualization(RVO::RVOSimulator* sim) {
  // Output the current global time.
  std::cout << sim->getGlobalTime() << " ";

  // Output the position for all the agents.
  for (size_t i = 0; i < sim->getNumAgents(); ++i) {
    std::cout << sim->getAgentPosition(i) << " ";
  }

  std::cout << std::endl;
}
@endcode

@code
bool reachedGoal(RVO::RVOSimulator* sim) {
  // Check whether all agents have arrived at their goals.
  for (size_t i = 0; i < sim->getNumAgents(); ++i) {
    if (absSq(goals[i] - sim->getAgentPosition(i)) > sim->getAgentRadius(i) * sim->getAgentRadius(i)) {
      // Agent is further away from its goal than one radius.
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
@endcode

Using similar functions as the ones used in this example, the user can access
information about other parameters of the agents, as well as the global
parameters, and the obstacles. See the documentation of the class
RVO::RVOSimulator for an exhaustive list of public functions for retrieving
simulation information.

@section    manip       Manipulating the Simulation

During the simulation, the user can manipulate the simulation, for instance by
changing the global parameters, or changing the parameters of the agents
(potentially causing abrupt different behavior). It is also possible to give the
agents a new position, which make them jump through the scene.
New agents can be added to the simulation at any time.

See the documentation of the class RVO::RVOSimulator for an exhaustive list of
public functions for manipulating the simulation.

To provide global guidance to the agents, the preferred velocities of the agents
can be changed ahead of each simulation step. In the above example program, this
happens in the method setPreferredVelocities(...). Here we give an example that
simply sets the preferred velocity to the unit vector towards the agent's goal
for each agent (i.e., the preferred speed is 1.0).

@code
void setPreferredVelocities(RVO::RVOSimulator* sim) {
  // Set the preferred velocity for each agent.
  for (size_t i = 0; i < sim->getNumAgents(); ++i) {
    if (absSq(goals[i] - sim->getAgentPosition(i)) < sim->getAgentRadius(i) * sim->getAgentRadius(i) ) {
      // Agent is within one radius of its goal, set preferred velocity to zero
      sim->setAgentPrefVelocity(i, RVO::Vector3());
    } else {
      // Agent is far away from its goal, set preferred velocity as unit vector towards agent's goal.
      sim->setAgentPrefVelocity(i, normalize(goals[i] - sim->getAgentPosition(i)));
    }
  }
}
@endcode
