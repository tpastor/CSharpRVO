RVO2-3D Library

RVO2-3D Library is an easy-to-use C++ implementation of the Optimal Reciprocal
Collision Avoidance (ORCA) formalism for multi-agent simulation in three
dimensions. RVO2-3D Library automatically uses parallelism for computing the motion
of the agents if your machine has multiple processors and  your compiler
supports OpenMP.
