# RVOs Library Wrapper for C#

This project just provide two wrapper (using Managed C++) for RVO3D and RVO2. (some use case demos also added)

RVO2 (Reciprocal Collision Avoidance for Real-Time Multi-Agent Simulation Implementation) Library is an easy-to-use C++ implementation of the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance
(ORCA) formalism for multi-agent simulation. RVO2 Library automatically uses parallellism for computing the motion of the agents if your machine has multiple processors and your compiler
supports OpenMP.

More Details can be found here http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO2/ and in the doc/ subdirectory of each project
